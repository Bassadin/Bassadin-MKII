        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Bastian, a software developer from Germany. While my current
            focus is Full Stack Web Development (buzz word bingo, woop woop),
            I've dabbled in Game Development, Embedded Programming, Home
            Automation and other directions of IT before. I love to learn about
            new technologies. Clean and structured code is very important to me.
